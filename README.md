# Image Slider Project

This project consists of a simple image slider that allows users to navigate through a series of images using mouse or touch gestures.

## Files

### `index.html`

This is the main HTML document for the project. It sets up the structure of the image slider, including the container (`#image-track`) and individual images. It also links to the external stylesheet and includes viewport settings for responsiveness.

### `style.css`

This stylesheet contains the visual styling for the image slider. It includes styles for the body, the image track, and the individual images. The key features are setting the size of the images and ensuring they are displayed in a horizontal row with the correct spacing.

### `index.js`

This JavaScript file provides the interactive functionality of the image slider. It handles mouse and touch events to enable users to scroll through the images. The script calculates the movement of the mouse or touch gesture and translates the image track accordingly. The animations are smooth and user-friendly, ensuring a pleasant browsing experience.
